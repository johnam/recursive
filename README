(((     THE RECURSIVE BENCHMARK     )))

`rake bench`   for a nice CSV-file
`rake rebench` for a nice fresh CSV-file
`rake json`    for a nice JSON-file
`rake flot`    for a nice HTML-file
`rake build`   for a nice standalone HTML-directory
`rake publish` for a nice gh-pages branch
`rake clean`   for a nice clean directory

Have a look in base.rb for the code,
and see Rakefile for a few settings.
